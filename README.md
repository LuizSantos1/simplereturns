## Description

Simple Returns provides robust RMA functionality for Magento Open Source. It extends the basic
RMA capabilities built into Magento Open Source (not to be confused with `Magento_Rma`, which
is available with Magento Commerce), and offers several additional features, such as:

+ Customer shipping label generation
+ Status updates via email
+ File attachments
+ Order search

## Installation

```
composer require auroraextensions/simplereturns
```
